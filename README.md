<h1>Sign Language Detection - Python Neural Network</h1>
<p>First Machine Learning project following YouTube video to determine/predict the sign language meaning.</p>
<p>Different codes have been created to extract body points while doing the signs (data used to train the model), to create the Neural Network model and train it, and to run the program 
where the model will be used to determine which sign is detected (a determined time period is used to capture data from the moviment, not only of one specific time frame).</p>
